# Face
## Compositional Project
### Jeffrey Hung | Regan Fung


*The goal of “Face” is to simulate an environment where the process of modern consumption of media will be reflected in how the viewers react to our interactive video. When a problem presents itself at a global scale, every news outlet and social media outlet gets flooded with content on the particular topic. This causes users and viewers to slowly grow apathetic to the problem being presented. This presents a problem where as more and more people become apathetic, the problem grows worse and worse until it is irreversible. Media consumption is changing at a rapid pace, and it is important for us as consumers to reflect on how we subconsciously react to what we are shown instead of simply scrolling endlessly through the content.*
